## About
HBnB is a clone of Air BnB. The project is divided into 7 parts:
1. The console
2. HTML
3. MySQL
4. Fabric
5. Flask
6. REST API
7. Web dynamic

## The Console

The Console is the first part of the HBnB clone. In it, we wrote classes for representing users and listings, a file storage engine for saving and recalling data between interactive sessions, as well as a command interpreter for easily managing our data.
The HBnB source defines custom classes for representing data relevent to this project (users, amenities, cities, etc.).

### HBnB CLI â€” The command interpreter

The HBnB CLI (command line interpreter) provides a convenient command line interface specifically to manage (add, delete, modify, etc.) HBnB data.
It offers an imporved workflow over alternatives such as embedding data in the source code, manually managing a data file, or using the Python interpreter to manage the data.

### Commands
* `all`
* `create`
* `destroy`
* `help`
* `quit` - also quit with `^-D` or `EOF`
* `show`
* `update`

### Usage

Start an interactive HBnB CLI session by executing `console.py`:

`./console.py`

If it runs sucessfully, it will display the prompt and await input:

`(hbnb) `

Simply type any valid command(s) listed above. `quit` to exit the interactive session.

The HBnB CLI may also be used non-interacively by piping input to it from a shell:

`$ echo "help" | ./console.py`


### Examples
```
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
```
